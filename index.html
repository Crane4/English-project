                <p>Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death and injury worldwide, and Saudi Arabia faces significant challenges in this area. Every day, thousands of people are involved in traffic accidents that could have been prevented with proper awareness, safe driving practices, and adherence to traffic laws.</p>
                <p>This project focuses specifically on car accident prevention in Saudi Arabia, aiming to raise awareness about the causes of car accidents and provide practical prevention strategies that can help reduce the number of traffic-related incidents and save lives on our roads.</p>
                <p>Understanding the common causes of car accidents and implementing preventive measures is crucial for protecting ourselves, our passengers, and other road users. With the Kingdom's Vision 2030 goals emphasizing road safety improvements, awareness and education are more important than ever.</p>

                    <p>Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of traffic accidents in the world. Road traffic accidents are a major public health concern in the Kingdom, with significant economic and social impacts on society.</p>
                    <h3>Key Challenges in Saudi Arabia:</h3>
                    <ul class="saudi-list">
                        <li>High-speed driving on highways and urban roads</li>
                        <li>Low seatbelt usage rates, especially among passengers</li>
                        <li>Mobile phone use while driving</li>
                        <li>Reckless driving behaviors and lack of adherence to traffic laws</li>
                        <li>Limited awareness about road safety measures</li>
                        <li>High number of young drivers involved in accidents</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Saudi government, through various initiatives and Vision 2030 goals, has been working to improve road safety through stricter traffic laws, public awareness campaigns, and infrastructure improvements. According to recent reports, 77% of Saudi roads now meet international safety standards, showing significant progress in road safety infrastructure.</p>

                        <p>Using mobile phones, eating, adjusting the radio, or other distractions while driving significantly increases the risk of accidents. Texting while driving is particularly dangerous as it takes your eyes off the road for an average of 5 seconds.</p>
